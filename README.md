# Portfolio Project with Bootstrap
## Introduction 

For my additional portfolio project I used this website as an inspiration:
http://www.jdcdesignstudio.com/index.html

I really enjoyed emulating this designers style and I learned a lot from disecting his style sheet. Seeing the way someone who is very experienced in web design write their CSS sheet was really cool. There were little short hands and tricks that I did not know you could do. This will definitely help me with my CSS in the future.

 Some challenges I encountered was I had to find the font that he was using and link them manually. I had to go into Photoshop to create he jumbotron image you see when you load the page. 

 Coming into this project I had a color theme in mind and I think that is what I like most about this website, it's the colors I chose. The layout is clean and simple and really allows for the color to shine. I plan on revisiting this website in the future and adding some of the animations and jQuery elements that was found in the inspiration.
